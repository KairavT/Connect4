A small Connect 4 game I (Kairav Tupil) made in March 2024.
The board uses the letter 'r' to represent red (red colour token for the Connect 4 board).
Uses the letter 'y' to represent yellow.
If you don't run it from some IDE, it (the window with the game) will immediately close upon completion of the game.
